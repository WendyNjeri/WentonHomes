          <p>
            Being in the field for over an year has given us the user experience to know what exactly our customers want
            and what they desire in a home to bring up their kids.
            This has alos equiped us with the skill to look for apartments that are in safe neighborhoods and those that 
            are pocket friendly to fit all genders and race in our community.
          </p>
          <blockquote class="text-capitalize">Our Purpose</blockquote>
          <p>
            We create opportunity for everyone to make a fresh start.
            We believe finding your new apartment is more than just a move. It’s something bigger. A step forward. A new beginning. A fresh start. Whether you’re moving across the country or across the street, you deserve to love where you land.
            But today’s rental experience is broken. It’s outdated, exhausting, and slow. We spend hours of our lives searching just to settle for places that don’t feel like home. The nightmare ends now.
            Zumper is on a mission to change the way you rent, forever. To make it easier, faster, and more human. By making this vision a reality, we’re creating opportunity for everyone to live better—from one fresh start to the next.
